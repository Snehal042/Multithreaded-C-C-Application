# Multithreaded-C-C-Application
## Compilation and Execution Instructions:
## Compile the Code:

### Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing the C source code file.
Compile the code using the following command:
bash
Copy code
gcc -pthread -o multithreaded_program your_code_file.c
Replace your_code_file.c with the actual name of your C source code file.
Run the Executable with Command Line Arguments:

After successful compilation, you can run the executable with command line arguments. For example:
bash
Copy code
./multithreaded_program 5 10
This command runs the program with the arguments 5 and 10.
Design Explanation:
The program processes data concurrently using two threads. Each thread processes one piece of data. The pthread_mutex_t is used for synchronization to ensure the correct printing of processed data.
Additional Notes:
Extensibility:

The provided code is a starting point. You can extend the processData function to include more complex data processing logic based on your application requirements.
Optimizations:

Depending on the actual data processing logic, consider optimizing the algorithm for better performance.
Error Handling:

The program checks for the correct number of command-line arguments. Enhance error handling further if needed.
